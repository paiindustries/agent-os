# Wheels Test Runner

Execute TestBox tests for Wheels CFML applications with comprehensive reporting, multi-engine support, and intelligent failure analysis.

## Usage

This command provides intelligent test execution for Wheels applications, leveraging the wheels-test agent for detailed analysis and multi-engine validation.

### Basic Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
/wheels-test run

# Run specific test bundle
/wheels-test run --bundle=tests.specs.models.UserTest

# Run tests by category
/wheels-test unit
/wheels-test integration
/wheels-test controllers
/wheels-test models

# Run tests with coverage
/wheels-test coverage

# TDD watch mode
/wheels-test watch
```

## Implementation Workflow

When this command is executed, follow these steps:

### 1. Test Environment Preparation
```
PREPARE test environment:
1. Verify test database exists and is accessible
2. Check that test migrations are up to date
3. Confirm CFML engine is compatible
4. Validate TestBox installation
5. Ensure server is running on correct port
```

### 2. Test Execution Strategy
```
DETERMINE test execution approach:
- Full test suite vs specific tests
- Single engine vs multi-engine testing
- Coverage analysis requirements
- Performance monitoring needs
- Watch mode vs single execution
```

### 3. Specialized Agent Delegation
```
USE wheels-test agent to:
- Execute TestBox commands with proper parameters
- Monitor test execution progress
- Capture and analyze test results
- Generate detailed failure reports
- Provide actionable fix recommendations
```

### 4. Multi-Engine Testing
```
FOR multi-engine validation:
1. DETECT available CFML engines (Docker)
2. EXECUTE tests on each engine sequentially
3. COMPARE results across engines
4. IDENTIFY engine-specific issues
5. GENERATE compatibility matrix
```

## Test Execution Modes

### Standard Test Execution
```bash
# Basic TestBox execution
box wheels test --reporter=console

# With specific configuration
box wheels test \
  --bundles=tests.specs.models \
  --reporter=json \
  --outputFile=test-results.json
```

### Wheels-Specific Test Patterns
```bash
# Using Wheels CLI integration
wheels test run
wheels test:unit      # Unit tests only
wheels test:integration  # Integration tests only
wheels test:coverage  # With coverage analysis
wheels test:watch     # TDD watch mode
```

### Advanced Test Execution
```bash
# Multi-engine testing with Docker
for engine in lucee lucee6 adobe2021 adobe2023 boxlang; do
  echo "Testing on $engine..."
  docker compose up $engine -d
  wheels test run --engine=$engine
  docker compose down $engine
done
```

## Test Result Analysis

### Success Analysis
```
FOR successful test runs:
1. REPORT test statistics (passed/failed/errors)
2. ANALYZE execution performance
3. GENERATE coverage reports
4. IDENTIFY slow tests
5. SUGGEST performance improvements
```

### Failure Analysis
```
FOR test failures:
1. CATEGORIZE failures by type (assertion, error, timeout)
2. IDENTIFY root cause location
3. SUGGEST specific fixes
4. HIGHLIGHT related test failures
5. RECOMMEND testing strategy improvements
```

### Coverage Analysis
```
FOR coverage reporting:
1. GENERATE line and branch coverage
2. IDENTIFY untested code paths
3. HIGHLIGHT critical uncovered areas
4. SUGGEST additional test scenarios
5. SET coverage targets and track progress
```

4. REPORT compliance status
5. UPDATE tasks.md with test results
6. SUGGEST additional test scenarios if needed
```

### Post-Implementation Testing
```
AFTER completing Agent OS tasks:
1. RUN full test suite automatically
2. VERIFY no regressions introduced
3. CHECK test coverage maintained/improved
4. ANALYZE performance impact
5. REPORT test status to main workflow
```

### Continuous Integration Support
```
FOR CI/CD integration:
1. GENERATE test reports in multiple formats
2. SET appropriate exit codes for CI systems
3. CREATE test artifacts for deployment pipeline
4. TRIGGER notifications on test failures
5. SUPPORT parallel test execution
```

## Error Recovery and Debugging
